/*
 * 2026-06-30, common spinlock principle:
 *
 * spinlock_t is the architecture ticket-lock object exposed to shared code.
 * Callers use it for short critical sections that may be reached by multiple
 * pCPUs, IRQ handlers, scheduler code, or VM/device emulation paths. The lock
 * is non-sleeping: a waiter burns CPU until the current owner releases it, so
 * code inside the critical section must stay bounded and must not block.
 *
 *   shared state
 *       ^
 *       |
 *   spinlock_obtain()
 *       |
 *       v
 *   mutate/read protected fields
 *       |
 *       v
 *   spinlock_release()
 *
 * The architecture implementation provides acquire/release ordering. That
 * ordering makes writes inside the critical section visible before the next
 * CPU observes the lock as available.

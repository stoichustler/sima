/*
 * ARM64 dumpstat trace event IDs.
 *
 * vtimer events record semantic edges in virtual timer delivery, not every
 * guest exit:
 * - LOAD/UNLOAD: vCPU switch-in/out loads or saves guest timer state.
 * - SYSREG: guest CNT{P,V}_* system-register access updated shadow state.
 * - PPI/POLL/UPDATE: EL2 found an expired timer via host PPI, bounded poll,
 *   or explicit sync point and synchronized the vGIC timer line.
 * - INJECT/EOI/REQUEUE: guest-visible timer PPI was injected, completed by
 *   EOI, or requeued after timer/vGIC state changed.
 * - BACKUP/WFI: rescue paths for a running or sleeping vCPU whose timer could
 *   otherwise stay hidden behind a masked host PPI or stale LR.
 * - PENDING_LR/LOST_LR/MASK/STALL: diagnostics for LR ownership and host PPI
 *   masking when investigating lost or repeated timer interrupts.
 *
 * Guest trace events describe EL1/EL2 boundaries: ENTER enters guest EL1, EXIT
 * records a trap/IRQ back to EL2, and RESUME records return to EL1 after EL2
 * has handled that exit.

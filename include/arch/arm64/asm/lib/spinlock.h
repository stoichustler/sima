 * 2026-06-30, ARM64 ticket-lock principle:
 *
 * head is the next ticket to hand out; tail is the ticket currently allowed to
 * enter. Each caller atomically increments head and keeps the previous value as
 * its ticket. The caller spins until tail catches up, which gives FIFO fairness
 * instead of letting a later CPU steal the lock.
 *
 *   CPU gets ticket N from head
 *              |

 *   wait while tail != N
 *              |
 *              v
 *   critical section
 *              |
 *              v
 *   release stores tail = N + 1
 *
 * ldaxr/ldar provide acquire ordering for the owner entering the critical
 * section. stlr on release publishes protected writes before the next ticket
 * holder can observe its turn.
